## Website name
SHO_INENAGA

## Overview
I made this with myã€€MacBook Air (13-inch, 2017).
This web site is my portfolio site. I will continue to add new functions. Please watch this web site and laugh. Because that is the beginning of my story.
I can change the world ....

## notice
- The contact function has not been implemented yet.

## Future plans
- There are still a lot of problems so I will fix it.
- Implementation of still incomplete functions.
- Add Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and youtube icons.
- We will add more responsive design (breakpoint).
